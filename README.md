# Stocks
Based on the efficient market hypothesis says that share prices reflect all information and all stocks are traded at the fair value so that it is impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stock or sell stocks at an inflated price.

However, the goal of this project is to determine if I can develop a model that allows me to predict if a stock price will go up or down within the next day or week. When I say predict I don't mean 100% accurate, just a better then 50-50 chance of it either going up or down.
